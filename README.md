## Getting Started

There is no complex setup required:

1.  **Local Usage:** Simply open the `daily_workflow_pwa.html` file in a modern web browser.
2.  **Live Version:** Access the GitHub Pages URL (once deployed) to use the live version of the application.

## Deployment

This project is set up for continuous deployment to GitHub Pages.

1.  **Workflow:** A GitHub Actions workflow is located at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.
2.  **Trigger:** The workflow runs automatically on any `push` to the `main` branch.
3.  **Configuration:** To make it work, you must configure your repository's GitHub Pages settings to use the **"GitHub Actions"** source.

## Suggestions for Future Improvements

This application is a strong foundation, but it could be extended in several ways:

1.  **Cloud Sync & Multi-Device Support:**
    *   **Suggestion:** Implement a backend service (e.g., using Firebase or a simple Node.js server) with user authentication.
    *   **Benefit:** This would allow you to seamlessly sync your data across all your devices.

2.  **Modern UI Framework:**
    *   **Suggestion:** Rebuild the frontend using a modern JavaScript framework like **React, Vue, or Svelte**.
    *   **Benefit:** This would create an even faster, more dynamic single-page application and allow for more complex features like a visual calendar view or a rich-text editor for notes.

3.  **Deeper Integrations:**
    *   **Suggestion:** Integrate with external APIs like **Google Calendar** or project management tools like **Jira or Trello**.
    *   **Benefit:** You could see your daily schedule or pull in tasks from other systems directly into your workflow, creating a single source of truth for your day.

4.  **Advanced User Experience:**
    *   **Suggestion:** Add a **Command Palette** (like in VS Code) to allow for quick, keyboard-driven navigation and actions (e.g., `Ctrl+K` -> "New Task").
    *   **Benefit:** This would dramatically speed up interaction for power users.
